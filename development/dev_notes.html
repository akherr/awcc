<!--* Do we need separate tables for STAFF and USERS? (And: an ADMIN, for those who could configure the database. E.g.: default values for things like who gets notifications; add facilitators (if we will have a table for 'em)).-->

<ul>
<li>Should we have a entry/default value of &#8220;NEW&#8221; for <strong>StatusTypeId</strong> for new records in <strong>Program_Requests</strong> table?</li>
<li>RE: program date: Seems we are going to need another COL in <strong>Program_Requests</strong> table, since the <strong>ProposedDate</strong> COL must allow for fuzzy dates, and the actual program date needs to be a proper DATE datatype so as to allow searching/sorting/filtering by DATE.</li>
<li>Do we need anything like session variables or cookies to store user input (before Submit)?</li>
<li>How to change default engine to InnoDB (for foreign keys)</li>
<li>Do foreign keys operate &#8211; on delete &#8211; as CASCADE, RESTRICT, or what?</li>
