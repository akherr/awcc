<li>maybe/maybe-not this dir. will be at test server (wuddaythink?)</li>
<li>might be good to include a file of some kind (markdown, text, ??) to keep track of issues/questions/etc</li>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do we need separate tables for STAFF and USERS? (And: an ADMIN, for those who could configure the database. E.g.: default values for things like who gets notifications; add facilitators (if we will have a table for &#8217;em)).</li>
<li>Should we have a entry/default value of &#8220;NEW&#8221; for <strong>StatusTypeId</strong> for new records in <strong>Program_Requests</strong> table?</li>
<li>RE: program date: Seems we are going to need another COL in <strong>Program_Requests</strong> table, since the <strong>ProposedDate</strong> COL must allow for fuzzy dates, and the actual program date needs to be a proper DATE datatype so as to allow searching/sorting/filtering by DATE.</li>
